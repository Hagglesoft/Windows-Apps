# Windows-Apps
step1: UI- IDE
Step 2: Design the User Interface

In this step, we'll design the GUI of the application. You can use the Windows Forms Designer to create a simple To-Do list interface.

    In the Solution Explorer, open "Form1.cs" (or "MainForm.cs").
    In the Form Designer, drag and drop controls like labels, text boxes, buttons, and a ListBox to create your To-Do List UI. Your design might include:
        Label for instructions (e.g., "Add a task:")
        TextBox for user input
        Button to add tasks
        ListBox to display tasks
        Button to remove selected task

Step 3: Add Code for Functionality

Next, we'll add C# code to handle the functionality of the application.

csharp

using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace ToDoListApp
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        // Define a List to store tasks
        private System.Collections.Generic.List<string> tasks = new System.Collections.Generic.List<string>();

        private void addButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Get the user input from the TextBox
            string task = taskTextBox.Text;

            // Add the task to the list and display it in the ListBox
            tasks.Add(task);
            taskListBox.Items.Add(task);

            // Clear the TextBox
            taskTextBox.Clear();
        }

        private void removeButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Check if an item is selected in the ListBox
            if (taskListBox.SelectedIndex >= 0)
            {
                // Remove the selected task from the list and ListBox
                tasks.RemoveAt(taskListBox.SelectedIndex);
                taskListBox.Items.RemoveAt(taskListBox.SelectedIndex);
            }
        }
    }
}

Step 4: Handle Events

In the code above, we've added event handlers for button clicks (addButton_Click and removeButton_Click) to add and remove tasks. We've also defined a List to store the tasks.

Step 5: Build and Run the Application

Now, build your application by clicking "Build" -> "Build Solution." Then, run it by clicking "Debug" -> "Start Debugging" or pressing F5.

You should now have a simple Windows application with a To-Do list interface where you can add and remove tasks.

This is a basic demonstration, and Windows applications can have many more features and complexities, but it provides a starting point for learning about Windows Forms application development. You can enhance your application by adding features like saving tasks to a file, editing tasks, and more as you become more comfortable with Windows application development.
